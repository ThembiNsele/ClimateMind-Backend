To further improve performance, 
    A. Hard negative mining - training
        Basically: Train, Test on Training data, Identify all False Negatives, Retrain on those False Negatives
    B. A pairwise comparison which is not order sensitive (so 45 attributes instead of 90)

Regarding the integrated model, implement the necessary data preprocessing steps

Deal with conflicts in conservative vs liberal predictions i.e., smarter cooperation

Improve documentation of this codebase and the notebooks

Work on the explainability of the model. Generate some kind of feedback on why a prediction was made, to inform the user

Implement user feedback that would lead to more training instances
